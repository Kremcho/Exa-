            <br>
            <p>Information and communications technology (ICT) skills refer to oneâ€™s ability to converse with people through various technologies. Similar to information technology (IT), ICT refers to technology use for regular, everyday tasks: sending an email, making a video call, searching the internet, using a tablet or mobile phone, and more.                
                ICT skills could also include the ability to use older communication technologies such as telephones, radios, and televisions.
                Typically, ICT experts are called upon to integrate old communication technology with the new technology.
                Almost every job requires some ICT skills, and many require hybrid skills, a skill set that is a mix of technical and non-technical skills</p>
